# Connect 4 Game
This is my Connect 4 game that I created using Racket programming language.
first file has the functions that get and set the columns and cells in the game.
The cells are the individuals spots that the users pick to try and connect 4 pieces.
The second file has the game itself with the AI and functions that build the game.
